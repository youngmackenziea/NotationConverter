Language: C++

Implementing a deque, this program converts between the three common mathematical notations for arithmetic. Postfix notation has operators written after operands. Infix notation has operators between operands. Prefix notation has operators written before operands. This converter is able to convert from any of the three notations to another. The input is a string written in any of the three notations, and the output is a string converted to the new, specified notation. 

For NotationConverter.cpp and deque.cpp, header files are included to declare all classes for their respective .cpp files. NotationConverter.cpp includes all functions and operations related to converting the notation of the input string. deque.cpp includes all operations related to receiving information about and manipulating the deque.
